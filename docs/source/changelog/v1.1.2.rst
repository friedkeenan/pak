v1.1.2
======

:Date: February 5th, 2026

Changes
*******

- Drop support for Python 3.9.

- Remove :func:`util.annotations <.annotations>`.
    - Its prior inclusion was only to backport the functionality of :func:`inspect.get_annotations`.
    - With Python 3.9 no longer supported, it is no longer needed.

- Add the :class:`.Not` type.
    - This type negates the value of a boolean :class:`.Type`.
    - It is useful in instances where the semantic meaning is clearer were the value inverted, without affecting the corresponding raw data.
